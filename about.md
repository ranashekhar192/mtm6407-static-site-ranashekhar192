# About Me

Hello! My name is Shekhar Rana, and I’m someone who thrives on curiosity and creativity. With a background in web developer, I enjoy combining my skills and passion to create meaningful work.

When I’m not working on projects, I love reading, traveling, or playing music. I believe in lifelong learning and constantly challenge myself to grow both personally and professionally.

This website is a glimpse into my journey, and I hope you find something here that resonates with you.
